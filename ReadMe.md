ðŸŽ¬ SQL Query Exam - Sakila Database
ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
This project is part of a technical exercise using the Sakila database, which is well-known for containing information on movie rentals. Through several SQL queries, the objective is to demonstrate advanced skills in querying, analyzing, and extracting valuable insights from the database.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The goal of this exam was to test the ability to:

Retrieve and filter information from multiple related tables.
Perform complex queries using joins (JOIN), subqueries, and aggregation functions.
Efficiently analyze data to answer key business-related questions for a movie rental company.
ðŸ“Œ What has been done
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the key tasks completed in this project:

Data Extraction: Queries were developed to retrieve information like unique movie titles, actor names, and customer data, applying specific filters such as movie ratings and genres.

Calculations and Totals: Some queries focused on calculating the total number of movies by rating, the number of rentals by customer or category, and the average length of movies based on their classification.

Conditional Searches: Advanced queries were created to find movies or actors based on specific conditions, such as films released in certain years or actors who have appeared in more than a specified number of movies.

Advanced Filtering: Filters were used to find movies with specific keywords in their descriptions, identify actors who havenâ€™t appeared in certain genres, or locate movies with particular ratings and durations.

Complex Joins: Many queries required combining information from several tables using joins (JOIN), such as linking customer data with their rentals or actors with the movies they have starred in.

Additional Challenges: Some more advanced challenges were tackled, such as finding actors who have worked together in multiple movies and identifying films in specific genres with longer-than-average durations.

ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion
This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills applied in a practical context. From basic queries to more complex operations, techniques like joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions were used to extract relevant and valuable data insights. An excellent practice in SQL!
